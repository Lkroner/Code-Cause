		<p>Code Cause links more and less technical do-gooders. Coders can find causes that have been submitted by non-profits, charitable organizations and neighborhood organizers. Coders can build up their portfolios while contributing their skills pro bono to worthy causes they care about.
			<ul>
				<li>A Do-gooder can create a “Cause Profile” that describes their project, along with a list of skills and technologies they would need their prospective Coder to have.</li>
				<li>A Coder can browse Cause Profiles and express interest in a cause.</li>
				<li>Once a Coder has expressed interest in a cause, the do-gooder is then able to view the coder's profile and contact information.</li>
			</ul>
